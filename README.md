# DDL_to_CSV
This python script will convert Metasys .DDL files into a readable .CSV format.
To use this script you can paste in any directory containing .ddl files. The script will process any .ddl file inside the directory and create a corresponding .csv file.

The script will process any point in the .ddl with the exception of slave points.

The .csv is outputed in a format suitable for IOQ and FRS documents.
